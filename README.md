# Flavor-Chat-Client

Writing chat bots was my favorite pastime as a 15 year old.  I've revisited the hobby as an adult for old times' sake.  Flavor Chat is a chatbot for third party battle.net servers (PvPGN servers) that makes keeping in touch with gaming communities much easier (as opposed to keeping the original game client open all the time.)

BNCSutil.bas was written by Eric Naeseth, the rest is my own work.

This project was made possible by the community at bnetdocs, for researching and documenting the bnet protocol.  https://bnetdocs.org/packet/index
